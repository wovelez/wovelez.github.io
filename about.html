				<p>I'm a scattered woman with late diagnosed adhd who stumbled across crocheting. The hobby sticks for me, because it's a way to sit down for longer than 10 minutes without wanting to pull my hair out, scroll on my phone, or get up and do something. I love creating toys, wearables, and decor to give away to friends and family. </p>
				<p>I taught myself to crochet by watching YouTube videos and joining fiber art groups. Every day, I come across another stitch I haven't taught myself yet, which scratches my itch to consistently learn something new. </p>
